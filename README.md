# **ENGS 108 Fall 2020 Repository**
Included in this repository are assignment notebooks and datasets that will be used throughout the class. They provide a skeleton for your coding assignments so that hopefully concepts are enforced over debugging. Although these assignments have been curated throughout the years, this delivery format is experimental, so if anything doesn't work as it should please let the TAs know as soon as possible. 

# Getting Setup

---

This semester we will be using Github to host datasets and assignment notebooks and Google Colab to run all of our code. The process for getting setup is pretty straightforward and you will be aided considerably if you install the following tools:
1. Github Desktop (Available on Windows and MacOS)
1. Google Drive Backup and Sync (So that you can access your Google Drive on your computer)
